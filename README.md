How does it work?
- When you run the program, a total of 7 options will be displayed
- You will have to introduce the number on the left of the option, an integer
- If you introduce a number that is not in the list, the program will keep asking you for a valid option
- Otherwise, if you introduce a valid option, a new message will be displayed
- You will have to introduce the amount you want to convert, as a double
- Finally, the program will show you the final conversion according to the option you introduced
- If you introduce the option "7 (Exit)", the program will stop runnig
